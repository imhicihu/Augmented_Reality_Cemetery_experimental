# Rationale

* This is a collateral project from another one: a virtual 3d reconstruction of a Patagonian cemetery. Once the goal was reached, it enable us to represent it in `augmented reality` mode. 
So, this is a minimal portion of the whole project.
* Check out a 3D model [here](https://sketchfab.com/models/7d09135c67064218bd6b673fa9d5f74c)

### What is this repository for? ###

* _Process-workflow-checklist_ turning a 2d object and virtually transform it to 3d augmented reality object.

### Procedures ###

* Download the [AR Maker](downloads/ARMaker.pdf) from our `Downloads` section. Then print it to A4 page size
